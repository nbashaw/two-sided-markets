# Examples of two sided markets:
I'm reading through the harvard business review article about two sided markets, going through the examples of two sided markets, and doing a lot of research about them. Here are the examples:

1. PC Operating Systems
2. Online recruitment
3. Yellow Pages
4. Web search
5. HMOs
6. Video games
7. Shopping malls


## 1. PC Operating Systems
The computer is a classic example of an industry where you need killer apps in order to get people to want to use the platform. A computer is only as good as it's apps. People only understood vaguely what it did at the time.

> The price made the Apple II affordable for businesspeople, well-off families, and schools. It was in the education sector that its influence lasted longestâ€”although it certainly made its mark on business as the first platform to run VisiCalc, the first consumer spreadsheet program. It was the programs that really hooked people, and the Apple II had a great roster of educational and entertainment software. By attracting developers, a snowball effect occurred, and a new generation of developers became attracted and then obsessed.

At first the consumer side of the market was subsidized, contrary to the HBR article about PC Operating systems. I guess you have to have consumers first, then developers, then more consumers.
> The Apple II became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s, although this was mainly limited to the USA. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools.

They marketed it heavily to schools which gave developers a specific cue about what kind of software to build. It gave them a direction to run towards.
> Apple was aggressive about getting their computers into the classroom. The thinking was if they could get kids using them at an early age, they could build brand loyalty and have customers for life. 
>... Educational software was quickly infused into the curriculum. Typing tutors, math programs and learning games such as Oregon Trail were top sellers, and educators were quick to embrace the new technology.

They also marketed Apple II's heavily to people in finance:
> VisiCalc was an electronic spreadsheet, now similar to Microsoft Excel, only much more primitive. At first the consumer saw no need for such a product. They just didn't see the potential. However, when businessmen and accountants saw the hours that could be saved using this product, they knew they had to have it. Once the benefits were seen at work, it naturally trickled down into the home.

More on the exact value that VisiCalc provided to enterprise customers:
> Companies invested time and money in doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, where changing a single number meant recalculating every single cell in the sheet. With VisiCalc, you could change any cell, and the entire sheet would be automatically recalculated.

Steve Jobs on VisiCalc:
> There have been two real explosions that have propelled the industry forward. The first one really happened in 1977, and it was the spreadsheet. I remember when Dan Fylstra, who ran the company that marketed the first spreadsheet, walked into my office at Apple one day and pulled out this disk from his vest pocket and said "I have this incredible new program -- I call it a Visual Calculator," and it became VisiCalc. And that's what really drove -- propelled -- the Apple II to the success it achieved.

VisiCalc wasn't released until 1978, a year after the Apple II debuted. You had to have the system out there in order for people to be able to dream up apps for it.

Also, at the time when Dan Bricklin (co-creator of VisiCalc) was dreaming up his killer app, there were 3 companies making PCs and he estimated that between the 3 of them they had only sold 100,000 computers. That is not a big market, but it's pretty substantial considering the only thing you could really do on these early PCs was play really simple games (even though a PC cost thousands of dollars but you could play better games on an Atari for way cheaper) and write BASIC programs. The market was limited to geeks and academics.

The biggest question in my mind right now is what motivated these hobbyists? Did they think that PCs were the future, that everyone would eventually use them?

This article contains the biggest clues:
> The market for home computers was largely created by a group of hobbyists. They were highly individualistic home-based entrepreneurs who worked outside the big bureaucracies of corporations, academia, and government. Many of them did not have a higher education. Many of them had no business training. Many of them had no connections whatsoever with universities or government agencies. However, it was a grass roots movement of hobbyists that created what the corporate world had been unable to do. They created their own community (via magazines, stores and clubs) to obviate to the lack of financial, technological, and marketing infrastructure.
